    Number in the bracket is the score based on the question “Overall, this instructor was excellent” from the Universal Student Rating of Instruction form collected at the end of term. The scores are: 1 (unacceptable), 2 (need improvement to meet expectations), 3 (meets expectations), 4 (exceeds expectations), and 5 (outstanding; greatly exceeds expectations); “unavailable” means that the number of students was too low to process evaluations or evaluation was not provided.

            <li><i>CMSC 635–001 was a well–structured, graduate–level course with an appropriate difficulty level and pace. Completing assignments required effort, but facilitated deeper understanding. The professor delivered engaging lectures.</i></li>
            <li><i>Dr. Kurgan is an outstanding professor. The organization of the course is awesome. As a student, having all course materials and expectations clearly defined and organized from day 1 was refreshing. The canvas was laid out clearly and efficiently. The materials covered in class were detailed and applicable. I gained a significant amount of knowledge from this course. He uses clear examples and articulates his points well. His strengths are oral presentation and course organization. His knowledge is very deep, showcased when answering a wide variety of student questions.</i></li>
            <li><i>In my opinion, the other department of computer science professors SHOULD BE REQUIRED to learn how to organize their courses like Dr. Kurgan's. Additionally, his course slides, syllabus, and assignments were up to date for the current semester (Spring 2024). Other professors SHOULD BE REQUIRED to do that as well. Overall, Dr. Kurgan should be used as an example to demonstrate what a punctual, organized, and excellent teacher looks like.</i></li>
            <li><i>Dr. Kurgan takes time for each student and makes himself available and shares his knowledge willingly, especially if students take the time to ask. He was always present, energetic, organized, and engaging for each lecture he presents. He grades in a timely fashion and is extremely fair. Many professors here would do well to follow his example.</i></li>
            <li><i>Prof. Kurgan is the king of Data Mining and Machine Learning. He is an incredible professor who possesses a deep knowledge of every aspect of this course. No matter what question you ask him, he always has an insightful answer! He is truly exceptional. We are extremely lucky to have such an outstanding professor at VCU. His engaging teaching style and positive attitude motivate students to eagerly attend his lectures. Thanks to Prof. Kurgan, the Data Mining course has become one of the most popular and renowned courses in the department. Hats off to Prof. Kurgan for his dedication and excellence in teaching!</i></li>
            <li><i>Well–organized, well–explained lectures. Great instructional quality.</i></li>
            <li><i>Professor Lukasz Kurgan excelled in presenting complex topics clearly through well–structured lectures and relevant assignments. His passion for teaching, commitment to student success, and ability to foster a supportive learning environment were exemplary. Other instructors should emulate his engaging teaching style, organization, and dedication.</i></li>
